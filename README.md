# PERN Stack Chat App
## Description
A real-time chat application with JWT user authentication. Chat and profile routes are protected. Users can find and add other users to start a conversation with. 

## Live Preview
Note: Backend may take up to a minute to start up due to free tier instance spindown.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to deepen my understanding of full-stack development. By building this real-time chat application, I aimed to achieve the following:

- **Strengthen Full-Stack Skills**: Gain hands-on experience in designing and implementing a scalable application using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) combined with TypeScript for type safety.

- **Learn Real-Time Communication**: Understand how to implement real-time features, such as messaging, using Socket.IO.

- **User Authentication**: Learning how to authenticating users with JWT.

- **Type Safety and Database Structure**: Learn to setup TypeScript project and structure a full-stack application. Database migration and schema updates using Prisma ORM.

- **Enhance Frontend Development**: Practice responsive and user-friendly UI design using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

- **Understand Deployment**: Learn to deploy a full-stack application to production environments, including configuring database hosting and managing environment variables.

This project was an oppourtunity to learn and practice building a real-world application while improving my proficiency in developing dynamic, interactive, and secure web applications. This project was also a stepping stone for a more advanced project that includes real-time chatting features.

## Features
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Using __Socket.IO__ for real-time updates
- **User Authentication**: Login and sign up authenticated using JWT (JSON  Web Tokens)

## Technologies Used
### Frontend
- **React** with **TypeScript**: Learned how to build user interface with type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For quicker styling and responsive design.
- **Zustand**: Explore state management using Zustand to manage global state.

### Backend
- **Node.js** with **Express**: Created RESTful API for server-side requests.
- **Socket.IO**: To allow for listening for real-time updates to chats.
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring type safety in backend.
- **PostgreSQL**

### Additional Tools
- **Prisma ORM**
- **JWT**
- **Neon DB hosting**
